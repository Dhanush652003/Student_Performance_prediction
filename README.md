## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict student performance based on various input features. We have used a dataset containing information about students, such as demographics (age, gender), family background, study time, and previous exam scores, to train and evaluate our predictive model.

Key features of this project:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available at [Dataset Name](link_to_dataset). You can download and use this dataset for your own analysis or to train the predictive model.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the project notebooks)
- Libraries and packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file

To install the required libraries, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

1) Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-performance-prediction.git

2)Navigate to the project directory:
cd student-performance-prediction

Set up your Python environment and install the necessary packages as mentioned in the prerequisites section.

Open and explore the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory. These notebooks cover data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.

Usage
To use the predictive model for student performance prediction, you can follow the instructions provided in the usage notebook in the notebooks directory. This notebook will guide you through loading the trained model and making predictions on new data.

Model Evaluation
We have evaluated the predictive model using various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can find detailed information about the model's performance in the model_evaluation notebook in the notebooks directory.
